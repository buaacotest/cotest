<h2>How we test TVs</h2>
<br>
<p>LED or OLED? HD or UHD? Flat screen or curved? We put TVs to the test so you can avoid squinting at poor picture quality, straining to hear crackly sound or getting stuck in a menu maze.
</p>
<p>Big advances in LED technology (LCD model with Light Emitting Diode) have meant its rivals conventional LCD and plasma TVs are no longer in production. Next-generation OLED TVs are hitting the market, including both HD and UHD models. An UHD TV is his money probably only worth if it can also HDR. But now there's neither much UHD nor lots of HDR content to watch. The "curved" screen shows rather disadvantages, especially in cases of specular light sources. Modern TVs just can't match the old 'big box' CRT televisions for sound quality, particularly for powerful bass. Smart features can really enhance your TV experience.
</p>
<p>We give every TV a total test score and every discipline, feature or specification a score so you know which sets are the best and worst, how they compare to rival models. To see which sets are the best TV for your individual needs, please browse our independent and expert TV test.

</p>
<h3>Test organisations</h3>
<p>The independent and exclusively non–profit consumer organisations from Germany, Belgium, France, UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Scandinavian countries under the patronage of ICRT (International Consumer organization for Research and Testing), have jointly scrutinized hundreds of television models of all types, sizes and prices.

</p>
<h3>Test samples</h3>
<p>425 TVs since 2015: The consortium of the international consumer testing organisations scours the market to ensure they test all the most popular TVs that you'll find in the shops and online. The samples are purchased anonymously in shops on the respective markets. Neither press patterns nor pre-series models are testing subjects. To level the playing field our rating ignores price, and is based solely on detailed results from rigorous testing.

</p>
<h3>Test ­programme</h3>
<p>Every year, the test programme is shaped and refined to evaluating TV testing to reflect changes in the market, emerging technologies and fluctuating standards of products. Consumers are also constantly surveyed to see what they value most about their TVs. A research and testing lab in Europe has carried out the test.

</p>
<h3>Structure of the testing and rating</h3>
<p>TVs are tested in eight disciplines. The weighted average of the disciplines determines the total test result (TTR). Currently, the TTR breaks down as: Connections and tuners (5%), Image quality (40%), Sound quality (25%), Using as a multimedia player (5%), Ease of use (10%), Energy efficiency (5%), Smart TV (5%) and Using as a recorder (5%). The following lines describe how TVs are tested and what the general findings are.

</p>
<p><strong> A. Connections and tuners (5%) </strong>

</p>
<p>Our lab experts look at how many <strong>connections</strong> are available to the user, including audio sockets such as a headphone output ora digital audio output for a sound bar or home cinema system. They look at how many HDMI ports the TV has and whether it has HDMI ARC for use with a compatible audio system. They also check the number of USB sockets and whether USB storage can be added to use the TV as a programmable video recorder (PVR).

</p>
<p>Furthermore, the experts look at how many digital TV <strong>tuners</strong> the television has, including Analogue (RF), DVB-T (MPEG2/4), DVB-T2 (MPEG4), DVB-C (MPEG2/4), DVB-S2, 5V supply for dig antenna, CI+, DVB-T2 (H265), ISDB-T and CI+ 1.4.

</p>
<p><strong>B. Image quality (40%)</strong>

</p>
<p>TV image quality can be a subjective thing. Some people like warm, bright colours, while others prefer cool, crisp pictures. Therefore, image quality of each TV shall not be rated by just one person, but by three to five experts, who watch the same clips under the same conditions.

</p>
<p>The experts optimise the TV's settings to give it the best possible chance of getting a great image. They watch movies, studio and outdoor recordings with dimmed light. The <strong>signals</strong> are indicated by a broadcast-generator.

</p>
<ul>
    <li>TV via satellite (DVB-S2): 3 experts evaluate the image quality with HD (high definition) signals.</li>
    <li>Cable television: 3 experts rate the image quality using HD signals in compression standard (codec) MPEG4/H.264.</li>
    <li>TV via antenna (DVB-T2 HD): 3 experts judge the image quality based on HD signals in codec HEV C/H.265.</li>
    <li>HDMI (HD): Tests in HD are conducted by 5 experts using standard settings ("Home Mode") as well as optimized settings.</li>
    <li>Ultra HD (UHD): At devices with the up to now highest resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels), we use video material from commercial 4k-Blu-ray-discs, which is fed via HDMI. Five experts assess the impact of HDR (High Dynamic Range) on the image: more shades of colours and stronger contrast.</li>
    <li>Photos: The rendering of photos are checked via USB connection.</li>
    <li>Picture during fast movements: An expert analysed the fluidity of movement in the image and the appearance of artefacts (blocks), for example, in fast-moving scenes or camera pans.</li>
    <li>Viewing angle:  Measurements of contrast and colour changes are taken from a side view.</li>
    <li>Suitability at a bright environment: Is the image bright enough? How strong does the screen reflect the light from windows and lamps?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether images through the tuner or HD TV, we look for the following key aspects in TV <strong>image quality</strong> :

</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sharpness: How sharp is the picture in clips with lots of detail? The image should look crisp and polished without appearing over-sharpened or artificial.</li>
    <li>Skin tone: How natural is skin colour on sequences with close-ups of actors? People shouldn't appear pasty or perma-tanned when they're not supposed to.</li>
    <li>Motion: Does the image become blurry and details vanish if the camera pans fast? For example, while watching an action movie does the picture lose detail and clarity when things get frenetic?</li>
    <li>Black levels: How do the TVs handle a darker sequence? Are the black areas on screen deep, rich and detailed, or blocky and unrefined?</li>
    <li>Colours: Do colours look natural and realistic, or gaudy and artificial?</li>
</ul>
<p>We know from our testing that

</p>
<ul>
    <li>HD television is clearer, sharper and more lifelike than standard definition (SD) TV. This is because it is higher resolution, which means there's more information available to form the picture. The two most common types of HD are 720p (also known as HD-ready), which is slightly more than twice the resolution of SD, and 1080p (or Full HD), which has over five times as much picture information.</li>
    <li>UHD (or 4K) TVs have four times the pixels of Full HD models. However, it is for the human eye difficult to detect the difference between UHD and Full HD. Not even every second testing person recognized the pixel advantage of ultra-high resolution (UHD).</li>
    <li>An UHD TV is his money probably only worth if it can also HDR (High Dynamic Range). HDR isn't an alternative to 4K UHD, but rather a complementary TV technology that promises to give you even better, brighter pictures. Small differences in brightness and fine nuances, such as the gradient in the blue sky, disappear at normal HD viewing, but remain visible with HDR.</li>
    <li>The combination of UHD and HDR is suitable for the future. Watching UHD TV with HDR, you'll see everything on screen in crystal-clear clarity and sumptuous detail. There's so much detail and depth in the picture that it almost feels 3D at times - and you won't need special glasses to watch it. The catch is that HDR is currently only available on a few televisions (often the more expensive models), and there's not much HDR content to watch if you have one.</li>
    <li>There are big challenges ahead in getting UHD into your home. So far there aren't television programmes in ultra-high resolution to watch. Rather UHD movies are offered by video streaming of online video stores or on UHD Blu-ray. But both offers are currently still scarce and expensive.</li>
    <li>New LCD and plasma TVs used to come out each year, but big advances in LED technology have meant its rivals are no longer in production. Next-generation OLED TVs are hitting the market, including both HD and UHD models.</li>
    <li>The local broadcast masts are successively changing over to the future terrestrial television DVB-T2 HD. If you don't have a TV or receiver which can receive the DVB-T2 HD via antenna, your screen stays black.</li>
    <li>TVs with a screen diagonal of more than 1 meter have often particularly good image quality.</li>
    <li>Manufacturers conjure a better viewing experience with "curved" screen, but that could be a placebo effect. Our tests show rather disadvantages, especially in cases of specular light sources.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. Sound quality (25%)</strong>

</p>
<p>Three experts judge the sound of each TV while classical music or a drama film is running with actors speaking over background noise. This means we can cover every audio base to give you the ultimate verdict on TV sound quality.

</p>
<p>We know from our testing that modern TVs just can't match the old 'big box' CRT televisions for sound quality, particularly for powerful bass, but some top-end models are slowly catching up.

</p>
<p><strong>D. Using as a multimedia player (5%)</strong>

</p>
<p>To check whether a TV supports multimedia content, such as videos and photos played on it from a USB device or shared from a smartphone, the experts use a range of different files and formats with the TV to see whether it can play them, and in how good quality they are displayed.

</p>
<p><strong>E. Ease of use (10%)</strong>

</p>
<p>Our ergonomics experts check TVs for how simple and straightforward they are to use. This covers three main everyday scenarios that reflect how you use your TV.

</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Getting started</strong> :
        Is there an instruction manual or quick-start guide with the TV, and how useful is it?
        How easy is it to tune all the channels in first time, and then sort them into a preferred order?
        How simple is it to adjust picture and sound settings to get the best possible viewing experience, and connect up all your devices to the TV?</li>
    <li><strong>Watching TV / daily use</strong> :
        What's it like to change channels, switch up and down the volume?
        How quickly does the TV turn on?
        Is it sluggish instead of zippy when changing channels?
        The experts judge all remote controls supplied with the TV, and check the electronic programme guide (EPG) for everyday jobs and more advanced features.</li>
    <li><strong>I have lost the remote!:</strong>
        We look at the controls on the TV itself to see if you could get around the basic functions if the remote gets lost down the back of the sofa。</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>F. Energy efficiency (5%)</strong>

</p>
<p>All TVs are assessed for power use to see if they're super-efficient, or likely to drive up your energy bills. Using a special multi-meter, the experts measure the power consumption while the TV is on and in stand-by. If applicable, we'll assess the TV's quick-start mode. Finally, we measure the power use of the TV when it's switched off. In addition, the TV chassis is investigated on problematic flame retardants.

</p>
<p>We know from our testing that the plasma set would cost at least as double as the LED one. It was initially thought that new OLED TVs would be even more energy efficient than LED models, but our testing suggests that the difference in power use isn't so great.

</p>
<p><strong>G. Smart TV (online contents) (5%)</strong>

</p>
<p>With smart TVs we assess:

</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>Smart menu</strong> : If there's a smart menu system present, is it well laid out and simple to navigate with the supplied remote control(s)? Is the menu system fast and responsive, or slow and sluggish? Can you customise it with your favourite apps and services?</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>App store</strong> : Is the TV's app store well laid out? Can you easily find the apps you want, or do you have to trawl through endless pages of rubbish? Can delete pre-installed apps to make space for the ones you do want?</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Internet browser</strong> : Is it easy and fast to browse websites with the delivered remote(s)? Is inputting text a laborious process? Do you have other options, such as voice, or can an accessory can be used with the TV, such as a bluetooth keyboard?</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We know from out testing that internet-connected smart features help you get more out of your television and really enhance your TV experience. Most new TVs are now smart.

</p>
<p><strong>H. Using as a recorder (5%)</strong>

</p>
<p>Many modern TVs now enable you to enjoy PVR (programmable video recorder) functionality for just the cost of a hard disk drive or USB storage device. We don't just check whether a TV has the feature, we put every single part of it to the test, including:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>How easy is it to set recordings from the EPG?</li>
    <li>Are subtitles recorded?</li>
    <li>Can you watch stored recordings while recording another programme?</li>
    <li>Is it possible to record one channel while watching another (on twin-tuner models)?</li>
    <li>Can you pause live TV broadcasts (time shift functionality)? - we still find TVs that lack this feature</li>
    <li>Can you rewind live TV broadcasts?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Brands</h3>
<p>There are loads of TV brands all vying for your attention and money. However, the majority of people will buy a TV from one of the 'big four' TV makers – Samsung, LG, Sony and Panasonic. Samsung is the market leader in TVs, followed closely by South Korean rival LG, and both have huge ranges going from cheap TVs to super-premium, big screen sets costing thousands Euro. Sony and Panasonic have comparatively smaller ranges, but still have plenty to offer in terms of quality.</p>
