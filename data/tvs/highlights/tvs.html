        LED or OLED? HD or 4K? Flat screen or curved? We put TVs to the test so you can avoid squinting at poor picture quality, straining to hear crackly sound or getting stuck in a menu maze.<br>
        Big advances in LED technology have meant its rivals LCD and plasma TVs are no longer in production.
        Next-generation OLED TVs are hitting the market, including both HD and UHD models. An UHD TV is his money probably only worth if it can also HDR. But now there's not much HDR content to watch.

        The “curved” screen shows rather disadvantages, especially in cases of specular light sources.
        Modern TVs just can’t match the old 'big box' CRT televisions for sound quality, particularly for powerful bass. Smart features can really enhance your TV experience.<br>
        We give every TV a total test score and every discipline, feature or specification a score so you know which sets are the best and worst, how they compare to rival models. To see which sets are the best TV for your individual needs, please browse our independent and expert TV test.<br>
