        LED or OLED? HD or UHD? Flat screen or curved? We put TVs to the test so you can avoid squinting at poor picture quality, straining to hear crackly sound or getting stuck in a menu maze. Conventional LCD and plasma TVs are no longer in production. OLED is hitting the market. An UHD TV is his money probably only worth if it can also HDR. But there's neither much UHD nor lots of HDR content. The “curved” screen shows rather disadvantages. Modern TVs just can’t match the old 'big box' CRT televisions for sound quality. Smart features can really enhance your TV experience.
