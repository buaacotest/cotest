     <h3>1.  Selected, tested, evaluated</h3>
      <p>
<b>In the test:</b> 11 general selling UHT whole milk products available on the Chinese market were tested. Six products are imported from Germany and four Chinese and one global brand products are made in China.</p>
<p>
<b>Buying the samples:</b> All products were purchased anonymously in September 2015 in Chinese internet stores. The samples were transported to Germany by air freight directly after purchase and were tested in the independent German labs we are cooperating with.
</p>
<p>
All results and evaluations refer to samples with the expiration date stated on the packaging.
</p>
<p>
<b>Price:</b> Purchase price September, 2015.
</p>

<h3>2.  Limiting factors</h3>
<p>
Degradations ensure that serious deficiencies have a significant impact on the test results. For UHT milk the following degradations were applied:
</p><p>
The Total Test Result (TTR) is totally limited by the three property groups contaminants, microbiology and Non-Protein-Nitrogen. It means that TTR cannot be better than the worst single result of the three property groups. If the unlimited TTR better than any of the three single results, it will be downgraded to the worst result.
</p>
<h3>3.  Basic Test methodology</h3>
<p>
The tests were carried out in a German accredited laboratory, the subjective tests conducted by three experts.</p>
<h4><b>Contaminants: 40%</b></h4>

<p>We have analyzed following chemical residues in the products:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs, non-dioxin-like PCBs</b>
<p>
For Polychl. Dibenzodioxins (PCDD) and Polychl. Dibenzofurans (PCDF) we tested according to EPA 1613, in comp. with (EU) 589/2014 VO.
</p>
<p>
For Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (NDL) we tested in accordance with EPA 1613 mod. in comp. with (EU) 589/2014 VO.
</p>
<p>Since January 1, 2012 and since December 2013 following new legally binding maximum levels and voluntarily applied action levels for the harmful dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in various foods of animal origin, vegetable fats and infant formula are applied in Europe (see. 2014/663 / EU of the European Commission's recommendation, Official Journal of the European Union L 272, p 17-18;.. Regulation (EU) No 1259/2011 of the Commission of 2 December 2011 amending Regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006): 
</p>
<p>- EU action level for dioxins in milk and milk products, including butter fat is 1.75 pg / g fat (WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ).
</p><p>
- EU action level for dioxin-like PCBs in milk and milk products, including butter fat is 2.00 pg / g fat (WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ).
</p><p>
- EU maximum level for dioxins in milk and milk products, including butter fat is 2.5 pg WHO-TEQ / g fat (WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ).
</p><p>
- EU maximum level for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in milk and milk products, in-cluding butter fat is 5.5 pg WHO-TEQ / g fat (WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ).
</p>
<p>
- The maximum level for the likewise harmful non-dioxin-like PCBs in milk and milk products, including butter fat is 40 ng/g fat.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Heavy metals</b>
<p>
For heavy metals arsenic, lead, cadmium and chromium we test according to ISO 11885 / ISO 17294-2.
</p>
<p>
For mercury we test according to DIN EN 13806; ASU L 00.00-19 / 4.
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Aflatoxin M1</b>
<p>
On aflatoxin we consider MSZ EN ISO 14501: 2008 standard. Only three samples were test-ed on a random basis. Since all results were less than LOQ (limit of quantitation), no further sample was examined.
</p></li>
<li><b>Pesticides</b>
<p>
Plant-protection product residues (GC) and plant-protection product residues (LC) were test-ed in ASU L 00.00-34 / ASU L00.00-115. Only three samples were tested on a random basis. Since all the results were less than LOQ (limit of quantitation), no further sample was examined.
</p></li>
<li><b>Inhibitor test</b>
<p>
For antibiotic residues we examined by inhibitory test according WEX 248.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Microbiological quality: 10%</h4>
<p>
The Aerobic bacteria count was analyzed according to ISO 4833 and ASU L 00.00-88. According to MILK REGULATION (Ann. 6 no. 3.1.2), 2000, the limit of the number of bacteria for UHT milk is 100 CFU / ml
Salmonella levels were examined in accordance with ISO 6579.
</p>
<h4>Non-protein nitrogen substances (NPN): 10%</h4>
<p>
NPN was examined according to ASU L 01.00-10 / 4 mod. According to Methodenbuch milk VDLUFA (Association of German agricultural study and research institutions) accounts for 5% of the total N to NPN. </p>
<h4>
Nutritional value: 30%
</h4>

<p>The nutrients were analyzed according to the D-A-CH- reference values.</p><p>
We examined crude protein according to ASU L 01.00-10
</p><p>
We examined fat in accordance with DIN EN ISO 1211und ASU L 01.00-9
</p><p>
We examined calcium according to ISO 11885 / ISO 17294-2
</p>
<h4>Declaration: 10%</h4>
<p>
We examined the package information according to all food regulatory labeling requirements for completeness and accuracy, further voluntary information. Clarity and legibility were reviewed by three experts.
