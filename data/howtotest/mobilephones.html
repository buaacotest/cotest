<p>In order to help you picking the best smartphone for your individual needs, we as a German national member of the independent ICRT (International Consumer organization for Research and Testing) having exclusively non – profit members from Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries, have started to jointly scrutinize hundreds of different smartphone products. The product samples are purchased anonymously in shops on the respective markets. Neither press patterns nor pre-series models will be testing subjects.
</p><p>
Evaluation is done in 7 categories like, ergonomics, navigation and others. The weighted test results from each category build the base for an overall test result. All evaluations that are not based on measurement are conducted by three individual experts
</p>
<h3>Test category 1: Handset Capabilties</h3>
<p>
Productive efficiency of a smartphone encompasses  the categories Synchronisation (5%), Handset Sensitivity (15%), Connections - Processor – versatility (14%), Memory (13%), Battery (40%) and Sound via integrated speakers (13%), whereas the percent values in the brackets represent the weighting of the importance of the category
</p>
<h4>Synchronisation (5%): </h4>
<p>
Our Lab experts investigate Synchronization with PC, Apps and Podcasts via cable or wireless network (cloud computing), and test with a googlemail account 
</p>
<ul>
<li>contacts (phone, email) </li><li>
calendar, dates - E-mails </li><li>
Music (via USB);video, pictures without additional software or internal shifting procedures</li><li>
applications (downloads from app stores).  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Futhermore it is checked whether it is possible to make a backup of the stored data and the phone’s settings etc.. The following aspects beyond the abovementioned ones are taken into account: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>wallpapers </li><li>
bookmarks</li><li>
Accounts</li><li>
Passwords</li><li>
Etc.  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Handset sensivity</h4>

<p>For the investigation a pre-compliance SAR measurement system is used, which does not meet the full standards of the SAR measurements, but is based on the same methods. We run the cell phone in a cabin with reduced reflection. 
</p><p>
The maximum emitted sending power under the influence of the hand is measured. A 2D-SAR measurement in combination with a conductive phantom hand is performed. The peak power level (sending direction of mobile phone, taken from the generator) and the 2D-SAR value is recorded. The emitting level, under which the connection is cut off, is evaluated.  A similar method is applied for the receiving direction
</p>
<h4>Connections - Processor – versatility (14%)</h4>
<p>
Some tests concerning the hardware capabilities (e.g. sensors, multi touch entries etc.) and computing speed are performed for the Android and bada smartphones.  </p><p>
In order to give indications for the processing speed of a smartphone, we run the benchmark test – in case of top models with high values – 5 to10 times successively. In some cases the devices get warm or even hot. While performing the tests we measure the hottest part of the smartphone on the display or back side. The warmer, the worse. If the devices automatically shut down or reduce their functions (e.g. no flashlight, no camera mode etc...), this influences the result, too. We combine the results of the benchmark tests and the temperature increase into an evaluation table and give a rating for the processing speed for all current operating systems in a reproducible way.</p>

<h4>Memory;(13%)</h4>
<h4>Akku (40%):</h4>
<p>
Nobody wants a phone that gives up due to power shortcoming before the day is done. So the battery is fully charged to find out how long one can use one´s cellphone until  the power needle is down to zero, i.e. we run the following cycle continuously. This is done in a reproducible way by using a robot arm that simulates a realistic use of a person. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>In a first step a “typical user day” / measurement cycle is defined:
</li><li>Stand-by (18,8 h) / 47 min per hour 
</li><li>Internet use (3h) / 7,5 min per hour (youtube video “I can swing my sword 10 h version”) 
</li><li>Camera use – 5 x taking picture with main camera with 3 sec pause, no flashlight 
</li><li>Navigation use (0,5 h) / 1:15 min per hour (Apple maps / google maps/earth scrolling, Here Maps) 
</li><li>Calling use (1h) / 2,5 min per hour (calling in or out) 
</li><li>2 notifications per hour (display switch on / vibration alarm) are sent to the device under test. The display off time is set to 1 minute. </li>
</ul>
<p>This cycle is repeated every hour. Besides the design of the cycle and the amount of operations per cycle the screen timeout is an important factor for the battery running time. </p><p>
In case of Android smartphones after the tests the detailed power consumption statistics were printed and analysed to recheck the video observation and checking a typical background operation. In case of drastic increased power consumption caused by “media server” (file update progress after restart or SD card changing for the MTP transfer) or “Google play services” the tests were repeated. </p><p>
Furthermore the charging times are measured in real charging mode. The charging indicators (LEDs or battery symbols) are checked every 15 minutes until the device displays that its battery is completely charged.  </p><p>
In addition a short 15 minutes initial quick charging test is done. The charging capacity in percent after 15 min charging is determined.  </p>

<h4>Sound via integrated speakers (13%)</h4>

<p>With the help of a measurement the quality of the built-in speakers is determined. Very often smartphones are not – or rather not – able to reproduce low frequencies. This leads to a very thin sound. Therefore a measurement of the different frequency bands – reproduced by the built-in speakers – is done and the energy in the lower bands is set into proportion to the energy of the most prominent bands. This ratio gives information about the balance of the sound and the portion of the bass frequencies. With the help of this ratio a rating for the quality of the built-in speakers is calculated.   </p>
<p>Loudness measurement of the speakerphone: </p><p>
The maximum undistorted loudness in sone was measured at a distance of 1m in an anechoic room acoustic chamber. The speaker of the phones points to the microphone. Besides of the loudness the description of the sound character is taken from the frequency (bark) scale.
</p>
<h3>Category 2: Ergonomics</h3>
<h4>Handset Ease of Use (40%): </h4>
<p>Only the main and general convenience is described in this part. The convenience for the functional parts of the mobile phones like camera, Internet or GPS is split from the general convenience part and is combined with the performance results like picture quality or speed measurements.</p><p>
To see how easily the handset can be handled in day to day operation, we test text input, responsiveness of the touch screen, kinetic scrolling, menu / configuration and putting into operation. </p><p>
Any ratings are given by 3 experts and presented finally in a 5-level rating scale. The ratings are commented comprehensively and detailed. They refer to the delivered user manual, the initial operation after unwrapping, initial operation like change settings as ring tone, ring volume or changing advanced settings. </p><p>
The aspects of Keyboard, keypad, touch screen are evaluated by lab experts under consideration of the design, shape, usability with small/big fingers, blind operation, pressure point, feedback (acoustical or other). Different persons describe their ergonomic impressions of the touch screens when wiping with finger, for multi touch (zoom with 2 fingers), kinetic scrolling, SWYPE (if possible), copy and paste functions and if possible with the supplied pen. A reference text is written by one person with each mobile phone in order to send it via SMS and to give an evaluation for the keyboard/keypad convenience. The necessary time duration for typing this text is measured.
For those devices that are equipped with a touch screen the responsiveness of the touch screen is assessed and rated by three test persons  </p>
<h4>Display (40%)</h4>
<p>To test how clear and bright the screen is, we appraise resolution, size, brightness and contrast ratio under various light conditions. So we can tell you how easily the screen can be read from side wards under certain angles, indoor in low light conditions, outdoor with bright sunlight or, if the contrast fades away, leaving you alone with an unrecognizable screen. </p><p>
The resolution is gained from the manufacturer’s claims and is checked by a binocular microscope. The resolution limit for the human eye is about 300 dpi. This calculation bases on the number of the pixels in combination with the display size. The resolution in dpi is responsible for the size of the details in the picture. </p><p>
The Display size is gained from the manufacturer’s claims and is checked by measurements.</p><p>
This measurement of the Brightness with a luminance meter in favourably dark light conditions quantifies the ability of the display to operate in bright light conditions. For these measurements the display brightness automation is switched off, the manual brightness is set to maximum and the measurement distance is 1 m, if possible. The mobile phone shows a jpg-picture with a maximum white picture part. </p><p>
This measurement of the Contrast (ratio of the luminance between the white and the black part of a test picture) with a luminance meter in favorable dark light conditions gives the difference between white and black parts of pictures and display contents. For this purpose a test picture with a 50% white area and 50% black area is showed simultaneously. This test picture is computer generated and transferred to the mobile phone first, if possible. The measurement with the luminance meter gives a maximum and a minimum brightness.</p><p>
With means of a fiberglass luminance sensor the spectral distribution in the visible area between 400 and 700 nm is measured from a 100% bright white picture on the display.</p><p>
Readability from sides is evaluated by lab experts in normal display adjustments in the camera mode. The same content is shown with different angles and positions. </p><p>
Readability indoor in low light conditions: This aspect is evaluated by lab experts with normal display adjustments in low light conditions (no darkness). In addition to this rating the aspect of the button illumination and button visibility of some buttons outside of the display will be included as well.</p><p>
Readability outdoor with bright sunlight: This aspect is evaluated by lab experts in maximum brightness display adjustments in outdoor sunlight conditions. Two typical display brightness differences are shown in the following pictures  </p>
<h4>Handset Portability (10%): </h4>
<p>
Ergonomic criteria also encompass portability issues resulting from transportation in pocket, key lock activation / deactivation, durability in the wake of build quality as well as scratch, shock and water resistance.</p>
<h4>Handset Durability (10%): </h4>
<p>In the drum, the mobile phones go through 50 - 100 falls. In addition to the scratch resistance of the display and housing, we also check the camera window (center). All phones are rained for five minutes. Most stand it without problems.</p><p>
We examine the accuracy and soundness of the housing, contacts and connections. Also we test, display, housing and camera window on scratch resistance. The scratch resistance of the display and housing, we check this by means of a hardness test in accordance with ISO 1518th.
We examine the fracture strength in a drum in accordance with DIN EN 60068-2-31. We assess what damage occurring after 50 and after 100 drops from 80 cm height of fall on a stone floor.</p><p>
We also irrigate the phones in a lying position in accordance with DIN EN 60 529 five minutes each with 1 mm / min water and check the function directly in connection and, where appropriate, after 24 and again after 48 hours.</p><p>
Phones that (at least IPX7) are certified according to the supplier in accordance with DIN EN 60 529 as water-protected, we also dive in the on mode for 30 minutes in 1 meter deep water and check immediately afterwards and, where appropriate after 24 and again after 48 hours the function</p>
<h3>Test category 3: Calling and SMS (15%)</h3>
<p>
The acoustical tests of the speech quality is done by acoustic coupling between receiver and microphone of the mobile phone and the network via a dummy head for measurements in telephony. The artificial ear is used for the tests corresponds to type 3.3 according to ITUT P.57. In practice, this means that when the telephone is not held to the ear with optimum pressure, low frequency parts of the speech transmission are lost. The voice sounds “thinner” and becomes fainter. This correlation is well known: if during a telephone conversation the incoming voice sounds faint or if the background noise is too loud, one presses the telephone closer to the ear and reduces the acoustic leak. 
In addition we conduct  POLQA and PESQ measurements. The POLQA standard was developed 2006-2011 by the industry. POLQA - which stands for "Perceptual Objective Listening Quality Analysis" - offers an advanced level of benchmarking accuracy and adds significant new capabilities for wideband and super-wideband (HD) voice signals along with support for most recent voice coding and VoIP transmission technologies. Therefore POLQA is suited to evaluate, optimize and monitor the voice quality of telecommunication items. </p>

<p>Four different situations were tested: </p><p>
1. Sending direction: speech quality without ambient noise  </p><p>
2. Sending direction: speech quality with pink ambient noise (70 dB(A)) </p><p> 
3. Receiving direction: speech quality without ambient noise  </p><p>
4. Receiving direction: speech quality with pink ambient noise (70 dB(A))  </p><p>

The measurements with ambient noise are introduced to make the measurement more realistic and with the hope that the measurement results differ more than the ones without ambient noise.  </p>
<h3>Category 4: Camera and Video (20%)</h3>
<h4>Camera versatility and quality</h4>
<p>We use the main camera to take a couple of pictures among other things of a test panel. How effective a phone stabilizes the image, we check in photographs and video clips in an experiment, in which so-called shaker simulates a shaky hand.</p><p>
Photo in normal lighting: In automatic mode with maximum resolution we photograph a test chart and evaluate the outcome in a subjective way and in an automated way by means of a test software regarding resolution, sharpness, contrast, distortion, color rendering, color noise and light sensitivity. In addition, we subjectively evaluate portrait and still-life shots and shots with zoom.</p><p>
Photo in low light: We evaluate subjectively photos of a scene in a darkened interior (10 Lux), which also contains a moving object, with and without flash. We consider using multi-axis shakers also how effective the image stabilizer works.</p><p>
Trip delay: We measure tripping time, focusing time and the time between the fotos takenin a row of shots .</p><p>
Selfie with front camera: We evaluate subjectively a photo of the front camera of a scene with a dummy in the foreground.</p><p>
The transfer possibilities to storage locations like PC, cloud, internet social networks or via Bluetooth or mail are tested and evaluated. Also regarded are aspects like the mandatory installation of software on the PC and the maximum possible upload data rates of the mobile phones in case of social network and cloud storage. In case of pictures, a Bluetooth connection to a PC is checked, too.  </p>

<h4>Video:</h4>
<p>
 In a camera pan we film a differently illuminated scene with calm and moving objects and rated subjectively the video and sound quality. We are using multi-axis shakers to check  how effective the image stabilizer works.
 </p>
<h4>Camera Convenience:</h4>
<p> 
Furthermore the following aspects of the integrated camera and camcorder and the possible transfers are tested and evaluated: 
Adjusting camera settings, taking pictures 
Starting the photo camera, adjusting camera settings, display quality, taking serial pictures or movie recordings. Important aspects are the consistency of the menu, the haptic quality of the shutter (mechanical or via touchscreen), the subjective shutter delay and the readability of the display (viewfinder-replacement) in bright sunlight conditions. The possible focus range (macro pictures) and the auto focus behavior is checked, too. In case of a digital zoom (zoom steps) the behavior in combination with movie scenes is investigated. </p>
<p>Saving, sorting and deleting pictures </p><p>
After the recording of pictures and movies, the possibilities and easiness of handling is evaluated.  </p>
<h3>Test category 5: Music (10%)</h3>
<p>
With many of us using our phones instead of carrying around a separate music player, we run an audio test to see what it’s like when playing your favorite tracks. </p>
<h4>Versatility and Sound Quality</h4>
<p>
We evaluate the sound quality in listening tests with sound samples from the genres pop and classical music on the earphones supplied and with high-quality headphones. If no earphones included, this will have a negative impact on the test results. We play different tracks which represent a range of genres, running from bass-heavy pop numbers such as Janet Jackson’s ‘Rhythm Nation’ to Rachmaninov’s Symphony no.2 - a true test of their ability to handle detail. Music formats (MP3, AAC, WMA, FLAC), transfer and convenience are also considered.</p>
<h4>Music transfer </h4>
<p>
The ease of the up- and downloading procedure of music files is evaluated. Furthermore it is checked if special software is required for this procedure and if connecting cables are part of the delivery. </p>
<h4>Music player convenience </h4>
<p>he following aspects are to be operated and afterwards evaluated by the test persons: </p>
<h4>Basic use and player navigation: </h4>
<p>
Test of main functions: player on/off, play, pause, skip, search and volume. Also the player navigation is assessed. Search for songs by ID-3 tags via folders or via playlists. Furthermore it is checked if long file names are displayed correctly (with or without scrolling).  
A rating for blind operation is given: The rating is focussed on adjusting the volume and skip to next song or the last song.  
</p><p>
The equalizer settings of all devices are set to flat or neutral. The listeners are free to adjust the volume setting to their own personal preferences. </p><p>
The test persons evaluate any sound flaws (e.g. distortion, inadequate stereo impression, interfering noises) and also describe the listening impression.  </p><p>
For the investigation of the sound quality with reference headphones (Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro and Sennheiser PX 100 - II) it was agreed to test the devices by just one expert. </p>
<h4>
Test category 6: Internet and Email (15%)</h4>
<p>
For internet and email, web browser convenience is of number one importance. We appraise the results from internet use, bookmark entry, loading pages in background (tab browsing) and history. We also asses features like surf speed, e-mail, data download deactivation and flight mode activation are also considered.</p>
<h4>Deactivate Data Download …</h4>
<p>
Lab experts investigate to deactivate data download, WLAN, GPS, roaming (e.g. to reduce roaming costs during vacation abroad), activate flight mode considering, whether these functions are possible and how easy their activitation/deactivation is.</p>
<h4>Web browser convenience </h4>
<p>
The lab experts give a rating about the overall web browser convenience and for using the internet with the smartphone. The ratings are explained with remarks and information in detail. </p>

<h4>Surf speed</h4>
<p>
Lab experts rate the Internet capabilities according to the following steps with a set of 6 websites: typing address, favorites, displaying of page (zooming), navigating, forms handling, indication of frames/iFrames, image maps, presentation of large tables, CSS standard formatting, Javascript, Flash. In addition the following abilities of the smartphones are checked: setting bookmarks, possibility of loading pages in background (tab browsing) and websites history. 
Only seldom the maximum theoretical data rates of the mobile phones can be achieved because there are many other users in the network and the coverage situation has to be stable and without negative influences. Resulting from these facts, in reality lower data rates may be measured than the manufacturers’ claims. But the measurements give evidence of the smartphones’ capabilities.
</p>
<h4>E-mail </h4>
<p>
We consider the function and handling set up e-mail accounts and when receiving, reading and writing emails. For the e-mail writing again a demanding test text is used. Especially because of the numerous special characters, the writing of this text is quite demanding so that differences in this test item become clear.
</p>
<h3>
Test category 7: Navigation (5%)</h3>
<p>
Navigation suitability is based mainly on the judgments of experts who rated GPS navigation off and on board with or without voice guidance. First GPS fix, sound loudness GPS and accuracy of positioning are also considered.
</p>
<h4>
GPS quality </h4>
<p>
In order to investigate the GPS reception quality, the Android apps “GPS Status” and “Maverick Pro” were used. GPS Status shows the number of receiving satellites, the first fix time, the GPS accuracy and the location data in detail. These tests were performed in an office with closed windows. Maverick records the pure GPS signals during a bike field test. We performed with each phone the same 4 km test track in order to record the GPS signals. These signals were transmitted and evaluated afterwards in the lab. The evaluation parameters were accuracy of the recorded dots, the time behaviour (exact position versus displayed position) and the smoothness of the signals especially in areas with a lot of trees and weaker signals to the satellites. For other operating systems different apps were used.
</p>
<h4>
GPS quality Expert rating (62.5%) + Sound Loudness GPS (12.5%)</h4>
<p>
GPS is tested with the GPS in onboard and offboard mode with and without voice guidance 
The use of cheap navigation apps up to 6 € is integrated in this part. For example in the iOS system the Skobbler App for about 2 € or the NavDroyd Andoid app for about 6 € is used for the smartphones..</p>
<h4>First GPS Fix (6.25%)</h4>
<p>
Before the first GPS fix test, the phone is switched off or the cache is deleted manually. This is possible with some mobile phones. The different fix times were recorded.
</p><p>  
For Android based smartphones the GPS Fix is measured with special designed GPS Status Apps, which shows the hardware capabilities of the integrated GPS antennas more precise. 
</p><p>   
More and more solutions are on the market, to overcome the dependency of the network information from WLAN and UMTS and to use preloaded maps from different sources like openstreetmaps. This would help the offline navigation solutions working in expensive roaming situations abroad.
Without a good working GSM/UMTS network the first fix localization takes much more time and depends on the history of the GPS data and region before.
</p>
<h4>
Accuracy of positioning (12.5%)</h4>
<p>
After this first localization the GPS signal is used for a very precise localization. Especially during driving and changing the own position the data transmission network is used for downloading maps and satellite layers as well as location based additional information. </p><p>  
The accuracy of the positioning is determined in two ways: After the first fix and after a 4 km bike test in different areas. The results of the position accuracy tests are rated.</p><p>  
The test program is regularly reviewed to adapt it to technical developments. The latest update has taken place in the beginning of 2016 and the last test program, according to which has been tested from to the 2014 to 2015, has been revised in some points:</p><p>  
Phone: The voice quality is the POLQA- (Perceptual Objective Listening Quality Analysis) to measure instead of the older method PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality).</p><p>  
Camera: Before 2016 only a subjective and not an additional automated evaluation method of photo quality has been used in normal lighting. The picture stabilizer at photos in low light and video has been tested before 2016 less expensive (without shaker). The quality of the front camera selfie has not been tested before 2016th</p><p>  
Internet and PC: In addition to local backup possibilities on PC by 2016, the online backup and Synchronization possibilities were evaluated by cloud. Stability: The breaking strength was before 2016 only 50 instead of 100 falls in the drum</p>
