<h3>1.  Selected, tested, evaluated</h3>
<p>
<b>In the test:</b> 13 general selling formula milk powder products for young children from 1 to 3 years old available on the Chinese market were tested. Eight products are made in China and five are imported from Europe. Six of the local products were made from imported milk. One imported product is for the children suffering from allergies and one is bioproduct.
</p><p>
<b>Buying the samples:</b> All products were purchased anonymously in September 2015 in Chinese internet stores. The specimens were transported to Germany by air freight directly after the purchase and tested in the independent German labs we are cooperating with.
</p><p>
All results and evaluations refer to samples with the expiration date stated on the packaging.
</p><p>
<b>Price:</b> Shopping price September, 2015.

<h3>2.  Limiting factors</h3>
<p>
Limiting factors ensure that serious deficiencies have a significant impact on the test results. For infant formula milk powder the following Degradations were applied:
</p><p>
The Total Test Result (TTR) is totally limited by the three property groups contaminants, microbiology and Non-Protein-Nitrogen. It means that TTR cannot be better than the worst single result of the three property groups. If the unlimited TTR better than any of the three single results, it will be downgraded to the worst result.
</p><p>
The incorrect declaration on the packaging, for example, high deviation of DHA or ARA from declaration, mendacious propaganda about the ingredients, lead to downgrading.  The bad single result gets an increased weighting, if it is worse than the unlimited group score.

3.  Basic test methodology
</h3>
<p>
The tests were carried out in a German accredited laboratory, the subjective tests conducted by three experts.</p>

<h4><b>Contaminants: 30%</b></h4>
<p>
We have analyzed the following chemical residues in the products:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs, non-dioxin-like PCBs
</b><p>
For Polychl. Dibenzodioxins (PCDD) and Polychl. Dibenzofurans (PCDF) we examined according to EPA 1613, in comp. with (EU) 589/2014 VO.
For Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (NDL) we examined in accordance with EPA 1613 mod. in comp. with (EU) 589/2014 VO.
</p><p>
According to COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1259/2011 of 2 December 2011:
</p><p>
- The maximum level for sum of dioxins in foods for infants and young children is 0.1 pg / g wet weight (WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ). 
</p><p>
- The maximum level for sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBS in foods for infants and young children is 0.2 pg / g wet weight (WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ).
</p><p>
- The maximum level for the sum of likewise harmful non-dioxin-like PCBs (PCB28, PCB52, PCB101, PCB138, PCB153 and PCB180) in foods for infants and young children is 1 ng/g wet weight.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Heavy metals</b>
<p>
For heavy metals like arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium and tin we tested according to ISO 11885 / ISO 17294-2
</p>
<p>
For mercury we measured according to DIN EN 13806; ASU L 00.00-19 / 4
Only three samples were checked on a random basis. Since all results were less than LOQ (limit of quantitation), no further samples were examined.</p>
</li><li>
<b>flatoxin M1</b>
<p>
On aflatoxin we consider MSZ EN ISO 14501: 2008 standard. Only three samples were tested on a random basis. Since all results were less than LOQ (limit of quantitation), no further samples were examined.
</p>
</li><li>
<b>Pesticides</b>
<p>
Plant-protection product residues (GC) and plant-protection product residues (LC) were tested according to ASU L 00.00-34 / ASU L00.00-115. Only three samples were tested on a random basis. Since all the results were less than LOQ (limit of quantitation), no further sample was examined.
</p>
</li><li>
<b>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAK)</b>
<p>
We examined Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons residues according to WES 341.
</p>
<p>
Only three samples were checked on a random basis. Since all results were less than the LOQ (limit of quantitation), no further samples were examined.
</p>
</li><li>
<b>Nitrite and Nitrate</b>
<p>
Nitrite and Nitrate were examined according to ASU L 26.00.1 / DIN EN 12014 Teil 2.
</p><p>
Only three samples were examined on a random basis. Since all results were less than the detection limit, no further samples were checked.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Microbiological quality: 10%</h3>
<p>
The Aerobic bacteria count was analyzed according to ISO 4833 and ASU L 00.00-88. According to DGHM: Richtund Warnwerte f&#252;r S&#228;uglingsnahrung auf Milchpulverbasis ausgenommen S&#228;uglingsanfangsnahrung im Sinne der Verordnung (EG) Nr. 2073/2005, 2012 the limit is 500 KBE/g. 
</p>
<p>
Salmonella levels were examined in accordance with ISO 6579.
</p>
<h3>
Non-protein nitrogen substances (NPN): 10%
</h3>
<p>
NPN was examined according to ASU L 01.00-10 / 4 mod.. According to Methodenbuch milk VDLUFA (Association of German agricultural study and research institutions) NPN can account 5% of the total N. 
</p>
<h3>
Nutritional value: 30%</h3>
<p>
The nutrients were analyzed according to the D-A-CH- reference values.
</p><p>
We examined crude protein according to ASU L 01.00-10
</p><p>
We examined fat in accordance with DIN EN ISO 1211 and ASU L 01.00-9
</p><p>
We examined sugar according to WES 780
</p><p>
We examined calcium, iron and zinc according to ISO 11885 / ISO 17294-2
</p>
<h3>
Declaration: 20%</h3>
<p>
We examined the package information according to all food regulatory labeling requirements for completeness and accuracy, further voluntary information. Clarity and legibility were reviewed by three experts.
