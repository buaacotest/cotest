    <h4>Mission</h4>

    <p>
     Association for Comparative & Objective Testing in Europe for Safety & Trust e.V. (COTEST) is registered as a non-profit association under German law. A group of multinational experts with extensive testing experience operates COTEST with the following mission: To test products and services independently for a safe and trustful marketplace for consumers in developing countries and around the world.   
    </p>
    <div class="about-img-container">
        <img src="img/cotest.png" class="about-cotest">
    </div>
    
    <h4>Powered by European experience</h4>
    <div class="col-md-9 about-para">
    <p>COTEST will buy samples in the respective developing countries but test them in European research labs, which – among other clients – have been testing for German testing foundation Stiftung Warentest and other members of International Consumer Research & Testing (ICRT), applying scientific methods, which Stiftung Warentest and ICRT have been developing and applying for over 50 years.
    Thereby, products produced outside Europe are tested in Europe according to European quality and testing standards. The access to the test results is promoted in all countries, where these products are sold to consumers. </p>

        <img src="img/icrt_c.png" class="about-icrt">
    </div>
    <p>Because COTEST exclusively acts in the consumer interest, does not accept advertising and is independent of commerce, industry and political parties, it has from the first day of its existence already joined ICRT, a global consortium of more than 35 consumer organisations under the leadership of Association des Consommateurs Test-Achats SC (Belgium), Consumentenbond (The Netherlands), Consumer Reports (USA), Stiftung Warentest (Germany), UFC - Que Choisir (France), Which? (UK). As the only independent international organisation for consumer research and testing, ICRT runs thousands of tests annually, on a whole range of consumer products from apple juice to digital cameras, laptops, mobile phones, drinking water, wrinkle creams and yogurt, and plays a key role in promoting higher safety standards for consumer goods such as food, health, the environment and services. </p>
    <div class="about-img-container">
        <img src="img/map.png" class="about-map">
    </div>
    <h4>Focus on Chinese Products</h4>
    <p>According to the EU RASFF (Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed) records, China is still the largest place of origin for notified unsafe food and feed products in Europe, and almost 60% of notifications in the EU’s Rapid Alert System for non-food dangerous products (RAPEX) concern goods of Chinese origin. In Europe, dangerous Chinese products are still countable, but in China, they have been innumerable for a long time. In China and around the world this really affects the basic human right to live safely. COTEST will therefore, at first, focus on the research and testing of products from China in order to empower consumers in China and around the world to consume safely and healthily.

    <h4>Investigation work</h4>
    <p>
        Following a comprehensive planning phase, Stiftung Warentest’s staff compile an investigation programme and purchase the test samples anonymously in shops, just like regular customers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Independent, external labs are then commissioned to carry out the tests on behalf of the foundation. Investigated services are used covertly by trained mystery shoppers. Finally, Stiftung Warentest publishes and disseminates the results of its investigations.
    </p>
    <p>Each year, Stiftung Warentest investigates about 2000 products in more than 100 tests. In addition, it carries out fast-track tests, investigations of services, and provides market overviews and research-based reports.</p>

    <h2>How to test</h2>
    <h4>1. Planning the test</h4>
    <div class="about-img-container">
        <img src="img/plan.jpg" class="about-member">
    </div>
    <p>First question to be answered in setting up a test is finding out which goods and services are to be tested in order to support the consumer in his day to day live. A selection has to be made from sometimes hundreds of different products in the same product segment or even sub-segment, because it is almost impossible to test all available products. Basically one has to answer the question, which product segments will be tested and which products in each segment will be selected for testing.</p>
    <p>
        The answer usually is strongly influenced by the number of products sold in the market. The assumption normally is that the higher the number of sold copies of a single product is the higher will be the consumer interest in the quality of that product. Technically innovative products, that often attract consumer´s attention or Bio products sometimes are selected more often than their importance in the market mirrors. Furthermore, changes or short term expected changes in the market regulations have an impact on the product selection.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is Important to remark, that manufacturers or dealers have absolutely neither influence on product segment and product selection, nor on the planning of our tests.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Test design</h4>
     <div class="about-img-container">
        <img src="img/testdesign.jpg" class="about-member">
    </div>
    <p>Once a final decision on product segments and product choice has been made the technical test criteria and how they are tested have to be defined.
    </p>
    <p>
        The test team creates a test design which encompasses every single test criterion and its sub-criteria. Usually this list is based on and in accordance with the legal regulations and prescriptions. This, however, is not sufficient where regulations do not exist (e.g. practical tests like usability) or have proven not to be up to date (e.g. endurance strength of bikes). In such cases our engineers, together with experts, define new test methods in order to improve the consumer experience.
    </p>
    <h4>3.  Product purchase</h4>
    <div class="about-img-container">
        <img src="img/purchase.jpg" class="about-member">
    </div>
    <p>
    Selected products have to be purchased in a next step. But how to buy a so called test sample?
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The test team usually buys the test samples the same way every consumer does. Anonymous test sample buyers visit department stores, supermarkets or shops and prefer to pay cash to avoid being traceable. No rules without exception: Seasonal goods like parasols are randomly picked in the storage areas of the dealers or manufacturers, because you cannot buy them in the stores before the season starts.
    </p>
    <p>
    To make sure that only products are tested that a consumer can buy we do not use so called free of charge test samples offered by the manufacturers.
    </p>
   <h4> 4.  Conduction tests in independent labs</h4>
   <div class="about-img-container">
        <img src="img/conclusion.jpg" class="about-member">
    </div>
   <p>
    After the test specifications have been designed the test team has to decide, which test service organization should test and at what cost.
    Usually non-profit test organizations like COTEST cannot afford their own labs. For economic reasons you cannot keep a lab organization operational for the whole year with all necessary state of the art testing equipment e.g. for washing machine testing, a product category in which you usually conduct one or two tests a year.
    </p>
    <p>
    The test team typically starts a tender asking three test labs for an offer. This is not only a best price race. In fact the decision is based upon price, competence and history from recent comparable projects with the bidding lab.
    </p>
    <p>
    Generally test labs have to confirm their independency by signing a letter of neutrality. It is obvious that they work for manufacturers. But they have to keep strictly confidential that they work for COTEST and have to confirm e.g. that they do not test the same test samples for the manufacturer and COTEST at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
    The same is valid for COTEST. As it is the sole responsibility of COTEST to publish the test results without making the identity of the labs public, also to avoid that the labs are endangered to be pressed by manufacturers, e.g. by threatening to place their test orders elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before making the test results public the manufacturers are informed about the test results of their own tested products. This is about to recheck test results that mismatch with what the manufacturers have measured themselves. In case of a mismatch possible mistakes can be avoided. Anyway, the final decision is with COTEST.
    </p>
    <h4> 5.  Verdicts based solely on test results</h4>
    
    <p>
    The evaluation system basically works as follows:
    </p>
For each feature or specification, a score from 0.5 to 5.5 is related to its measured values or evaluation results. Similar to German academic grading scale, the score of 0.5 represents the best and 5.5 the worst test result, meaning that a product with a total score of 0.5 is the “dream product”. The scores of all individual features and specifications of a sub-criterion result in a weighted average score for the sub-criterion. The average scores of all individual sub-criteria of a criterion result in a weighted average score for the criterion. The total test result (TTR) score results from the average scores of all individual criteria with proportionate weightings.
</p>
<p>
Each of the assessments described above contributes to a total test result accordingly to its weight in the TTR. A smartphone needs a score from 0.5 to 1.5 in our tests to earn our best rating “very good”, a score from 1.6 to 2.5 the rating “good”, from 2.6 to 3.5 the rating “average” and from 3.6 to 4.5 the rating “adequate”. Smartphones that score 4.6 or more are labelled “poor” to make them easier to avoid.
</p>
<div class="about-img-container">
        <img src="img/evaluation.jpg" class="about-member">
    </div>
<p>
But which criteria do we use to evaluate the individual features and specifications?
</p>
<p>
There is no simple answer, unfortunately. Basically the test organization develops an evaluation function taking two major aspects into consideration:
</p>
<ul>
<li>“Absolute” aspects being set like legally prescribed thresholds, requirements deduced from industry standards, scientific or analytical limits or expert developed quality standards.
</li>
<br>
<li>
“Relative” aspects like the differences between the tested products
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A more touchable explanation goes as follows:
</p>
<p>
So, not meeting legal requirements or industry standards usually ends up in very bad test results. Or to give an example for scientific aspects: A central-heating boiler that completely transforms the energy into heat would gain a 0.5 as to the criterion “energy efficiency”. Usually no product can meet such a theoretical target, but some come very close. These are only two examples on how the supporting points of an evaluation function can be found and defined.
</p>
<p>
Another aspect is the bandwidth of test results, meaning the difference between tested products as to all or select criteria. Evaluating the best test result with a 0.5 and the worst one with 5.5 would mean to overweight small quality differences. So, always the finding of the supporting points for the evaluation function is dominated by the relevance for the consumer. Products showing similar quality in a certain criterion get a similar evaluation.
</p>
<p>
The next step is the one we introduced in the beginning of this chapter, meaning developing a TTR.
</p>
<p>
Having the TTR does not mean that the evaluation result is ready to be delivered. Under certain circumstances so called degradations are possible resp. necessary. What does that mean? Evaluating the overall quality of a product the assumption normally is that weaknesses and strengths of a product can compensate each other only up to a certain degree. A washing machine that works very energy efficient (scored 0.5), but does not deliver spotlessly clean laundry (scored 5.5) would end up in midterm evaluation which does not mirror the weakness in the core aspect in an appropriate manner.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes a bad evaluation is in the wake of knockout criteria, e.g. a device that is electrically unsafe.
The test results always are enhanced with a detailed report that explains how the test was conducted, which criteria have been checked and how they have been weighted.
